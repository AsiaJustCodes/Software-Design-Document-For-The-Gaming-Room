***The Gaming Room software design Q/A***

-A brief summary of The Gaming Room Client and their software requirements-

**Who was the client?**
The client was The Gaming Room and they required a software application for their game "Draw it or Lose it." 
Which is a competitive online guessing game using stock images for visual cues. 

**What type of software did they want you to design?**
The software needed to support multiple teams, several players per team, unique game and team names 
and to allow only one instance of the game at a time.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I believe my document excelled in applying objected oriented principles through the use of a UML class diagram.
This included the use of inheritance, encapsulation and a Singleton pattern that ensured efficient performance and 
organization of the system to meet the game's requirements.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
Working with a design document gave me a clear idea of how I would structure this person's application, which helped me understand the
clients requirements and technical challenges easier. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
Perhaps the recommendations. I feel I analyzed the clients application to the best of my abilities but theres always a possibility that I may have overlooked something. One way I could've improved apon this section is by being more meticulous with my recommendations, like more detailed comparison of the platforms capabilities in relation to the games specific needs. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
The client gave me enough information to let me know that they were focused on core gameplay mechanics and the online, multiplayer nature of the game. The users needs were crucial for the final product with user expectations and requirements which is an essential part of a softwares success.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
I throughly analyzed the clients requirements, I also made sure to apply applicable design principles and patterns as well. In the future, I plan to use techniques like user story mapping, prototyping and possibly iterative developement which would help me better understand the users needs; I'd test ideas quickly and refine the software based on feedback.
